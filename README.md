# My Projects

Bioinformatics projects I have worked on.


## Part I: Development

Development of bioinformatics algorithms, workflows, and software.

### The Awsomics framework

**Role: Creator**

Awsomics is my brainchild, an ambitious attempt to fill the gap between information generation and knowledge discovery. Its aim is to facilitate the sharing, access, and analysis of genomic data sets via archiving curated genomic data on the AWS Cloud and developing generic and project-specific APPs for biomedical researchers.

### The RoCA workflow

**Role: Creator**

**RoCA** (**R**eporting **o**f **C**ustome **A**nalysis) is my solution of reproductive data analysis.
